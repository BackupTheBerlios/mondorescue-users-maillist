Subject: [Mondorescue-users] Problem but do the list exist?
Message-ID: <43C945CD.7070608@bf-data.dk>

I have tried to open the lists archive, but i get at "Page cannot be 
found"-error
OK my problem is that I cannot restore. I have tried on a trialmachine 
with Mandriva 2006.0. Nothing worked with mondo or mindi with the RPM's 
from the installation cd, so I fetched the 1.06 and 2.06 versins from
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/mondorescue/mandriva/2006.0/
Now I can use mindi and also mondo, after some work.
I have made at complete backup with mondo, but when I
try to restore the backup on another harddisk in the same machine it 
stops and cannot format the partitions that contains /var and /home.
Must I use a harddisk of equal or greater size, or is something wrong?

Hi,

I'm using older version of mondo under fedora core 1 and it works great.

I want to use it now on a fedora core 3 system but the new repository for
the rpms is empy for fedora core 1,2,3.

Is support for those older version stoped ?

Best regards,
Constantin Charissis

Subject: [Mondorescue-users] latest mindi-kernel?
Message-ID: <43D54C99.1050405@nextwindow.net>

Where can I get the latest mindi-kernel package?

Or should I just use the latest stable files from svn 
(http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/mondorescue/branches/stable/mindi-kernel/?rev=0&sc=0) 
and install using the script there?

thanks
